Description: static library, header files, and docs for libite
 Static library, header files, and documentation for libite.
 .
 Libite is a lightweight library of frog DNA.  It can be used to fill
 the gaps in any dinosaur project.  It holds useful functions and macros
 developed by both Finit and the OpenBSD project.  Most notably the
 string functions: strlcpy(3), strlcat(3) and the highly useful *BSD
 sys/queue.h and sys/tree.h API's.
 .
 Libite is the frog DNA missing in GNU libc.  However, -lite does not
 aim to become another GLIB!  One noticeable gap in GLIBC is the missing
 _SAFE macros in the BSD sys/queue.h API — highly recommended when
 traversing lists to delete/free nodes.
 .
 The code is open sourced under a mix of the MIT/X11 license, the ISC
 license used by OpenBSD, and BSD licenses, all of them are extremely
 liberal and can be used freely in proprietary software if needed.
